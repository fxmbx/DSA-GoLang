A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

# Operations in heap

Heapify: a process of creating a heap from an array.
Insertion: time complexity O(log N).
Deletion: deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).
Peek: to check or find the most prior element in the heap, (max or min element for max and min heap)

max-heap : arranged in order of descending (<= on the left & > on the right )
min-heap: arranged in order of ascending (lesser value on the left & bigger value on the right )
